    <description>Adds [5] new enemies to the Scarred Womb, along with over 120 rooms for them to occupy.

The enemies are as follows:
Scarred Baby, a Baby variant that shoots explosive, lobbing tears
Parabrute, a beefy Parabite that loves creep
Cyst, an annoying red lump that goes everywhere and explodes when killed
Pusy, a little idiot baby that summons Pustules to annoy you
Pustules, they explode into a shower of tears when you get close

 Please report bugs to me. Enjoy!</description>
