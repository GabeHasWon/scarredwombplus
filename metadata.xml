Pus-y, a little idiot baby that summons Pustules to annoy you
Pustules, they explode into a shower of tears when you get close
Overboiled, massive, scarred boils which shoot a line of tears repeatedly
Seespot, a grid entity that, after being steppped on, will boil over with blood
Clot Worm, a stationary enemy that rapidly fires projectiles, and when killed, throws bursts of blood around until everything else is dead
