      Adds [5] new enemies to the Scarred Womb, along with over 120 rooms for them to occupy.

      The enemies are as follows:
      Scarred Baby, a Baby variant that shoots explosive, lobbing tears
      Parabrute, a beefy Parabite that loves creep
      Cyst, an annoying red lump that goes everywhere and explodes when killed
      Pusy, a little idiot baby that summons Pustules to annoy you
      Pustules, they explode into a shower of tears when you get close

      Please report bugs to me. Enjoy!
