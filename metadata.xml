    <description>Adds [3] new enemies to the Scarred Womb, along with various rooms for them to occupy.

This has been cleaned up quickly; I started this several years ago and abandoned it until recently. I'll likely be updating some animations and sprites, along with adding more rooms and possibly enemies as well.

 Please report bugs to me. Enjoy!</description>
