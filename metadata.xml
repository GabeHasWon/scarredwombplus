    <description>Adds [9] new enemies to the Scarred Womb, along with 840 new rooms for them to occupy.

The enemies are as follows:
Scarred Baby, a Baby variant that spits bursting, lobbing tears
Parabrute, a beefy Parabite that loves creep
Cyst, an annoying red lump that goes everywhere and explodes when killed
Pus-y, a little idiot baby that summons Pustules to annoy you
Pustules, they explode into a shower of tears when you get close
Overboiled, massive, scarred boils which shoot a line of tears repeatedly
Seespot, a grid entity that, after being steppped on, will boil over with blood when stepped on - flying players ignore it
Clot Worm, a stationary enemy that rapidly fires projectiles, and when killed, throws bursts of blood around until everything else is dead
Exposed Nerves, a grid entity that behaves like Seespots, but only for flying players

Additionally, this mod also adds in a few resprites for vanilla enemies, and uses those in new rooms as well.

Please report bugs to me. Enjoy!</description>
